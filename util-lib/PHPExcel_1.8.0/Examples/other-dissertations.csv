The political changes in the electorate and their impact on realignment theory have been well documented. Others working outside the framework of realignment have increasingly noticed profound changes in contemporary society and the effect these social changes have on politics. What has been missing from studies that attempt to explain the lack of a critical realignment in the contemporary electorate is a discussion of broad societal forces that may be at play and the impact these forces may have on this theory of electoral change. Ronald Inglehart (1971, 1977, 1997) has long postulated that a value change is taking place in society that is profoundly affecting postindustrial politics.  Both Inglehart's theory of value change and critical realignment theory have expectations of cleavage behavior within electorates. These two theories are reviewed and the voting behavior of various cleavages is documented from 1952--1998 using the American National Election Studies. Many cleavages are increasingly showing decreasing partisan cohesiveness as Inglehart predicted, yet some cleavages are enduring, contrary to Inglehart's expectations. Because of the inconsistencies in the performance of Inglehart's indicators, a test of his theoretical assumptions was conducted. A lack of congruence between Inglehart's measure of values and his theoretical assumptions was indicated. Therefore, another indicator of change, party platforms, was utilized. A significant change is found in the way parties addressed issues beginning in the 1990s that corresponds with the disintegration of the partisan cohesiveness of certain cleavages. In the 1990s, party platforms began polarizing on cultural issues that the majority of the electorate did not feel were of primary importance. However, these are the very issues that are important to the cleavages found to still be partisanly attached. There seems to be a connection between the dissipation of many cleavages, the endurance of other cleavages, and the way parties addressed issues in the 1990s. Critical realignments will not occur in an electorate that has insufficient enduring cleavages and where political parties do not polarize on many issues that substantial portions of the electorate feel are of primary importance.","vii, 247 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/351,,"Adviser:  Allen D.

Also, Two-Spirit is a rallying point for social and political action among Native gays and lesbians. As an identity, Two-Spirit has come to emphasize social relations with the Native community versus that of the popular gay community. Two-Spirit people attempt to connect with the historical acceptance of sex and gender difference among tribal societies in an effort to reincorporate their uniqueness into contemporary Native communities. Two-Spirit people emphasize their cultural sameness with Native communities, while de-emphasizing sexual orientation as a personal defining characteristic. However, reincorporation is complicated by mainstream Native community heterosexism and homophobia. Two-Spirit people perceive that acceptance in Native communities hinges not only on their sexual orientation, but also their fulfillment of what ideally represents ""Indianness"" for communities. Accordingly, it is within the discursive dialectics on Indian, gay, and Two-Spirit, where the performance of identity is figured, translated and acted out, resulting in a set of exclusionary and inclusive features based on notions of cultural and racial authenticity. In seeking acceptance, Two-Spirit people attempt to ""find a place"" for themselves in their respective tribal communities through service to the people.","v, 251 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/441,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 63-02, Section: A, page: 0643.||Adviser:  Morris W.

Several model compounds and modified reactions were studied which implicated a nitrogen oxide adduct as a major and required element in the selective oxidation to the polysulfoxide rather than the polysulfone. The intrinsic viscosity of the PPSX polymer was determined to be 0.274. PPSX was successfully fractionated yielding a high molecular weight polymer identified by GPC (Mw = 84,000 and Mn = 30,800). Multiple unitary and binary solvent systems were identified for PPSX, and clear, free-standing, flexible films were cast with plasticizer enhancement. Thermal analysis identified PPSX as an amorphous polymer with a decomposition temperature in air of 334&deg; C and in helium of 342&deg; C. The activation energies of the thermal decomposition of PPSX in air and helium were determined by the Friedman method to be 32 +/- 6 and 31 +/- 3 kcal/mol, respectively. PPSX successfully demonstrated the ability to chelate several metals in experiments intended to explore metal extraction applications.||A novel polymer derived from these synthetic routes, poly(2,6-dimethyl- p-xylylene) (21), was synthesized and characterized. This amorphous, soluble polymer had the highest molecular weight of any literature reported xylylene polymer measured by GPC (Mw = 150,500 and Mn = 60,5 10). The polymer 21 exhibited excellent thermal stability in helium and air. The onset of thermal decomposition in air (424&deg; C) was more than 100&deg; C higher than all non-fluorinated xylylene polymers. Excellent quality, freestanding, flexible films of 21 were cast from chloroform.||With the goal of better understanding previously documented, structurally related, exothermic decompositions of polynitro-paracyclophanes (polynitroPCP), two novel tetramethyl-tetranitro-[2.2]paracyclophanes and their related polymer were synthesized and characterized: 4,8,12,16-tetramethyl-5,7,13,15-tetranitro[2.2]paracyclophane (45) and 4,8,13,15-tetramethyl-5,7,12,16-tetranitro[2.2]paracyclophane (46), and poly(2,6-dimethyl-3, 5-dinitro-p-xylylene) (20). These compounds and previously synthesized dinitro[2.2]PCP's were characterized by DSC thermal analysis techniques. Compounds 45, 46, and 20 decomposed exothermically at 314, 303, and 281&deg; C, respectively. The exothermic decompositions of the polynitroPCP's are not a product of the strain in the dimer [2.2]PCP members of this class, but rather a feature of the ethano bridge system. The elevation of the decomposition temperatures by 33&deg; C in the non-polymer polynitroPCP's is likely due to an attenuation of intermolecular nitro group interactions caused by intramolecular nitro group orientation restrictions. A smaller 10&deg; C decomposition temperature variation in the dinitro[2.2]PCP's follows a similar trend of likely nitro group orientation restrictions. The severely basic and nucleophilic conditions of the Hofmann elimination also proved incompatible to the synthesis of less methylated polynitroPCP's.",215 p.,http://hdl.handle.net/11244/1019,,"Adviser: Daniel T.

The dominant iron species in acid mine drainage was Fe(II). In areas of the receiving stream where precipitation occurred, FE(III) species dominated. Based on the presence of various Fe(III) species detected by UV-spectroscopy, two distinctly separate pathways for precipitation of Fe-oxide were suggested. In the stream, polymer growth resulted in ferrihydrite. In contrast, contact (direct) precipitation of goethite appeared to occur from mine discharge waters in contact with soil surfaces.||The yellow precipitate was isolated, identified as poorly-ordered ferrihydrite, and compared to synthetic ferrihydrites that were hydrolyzed and precipitated in the presence of graded levels of SO(, 4). Based on increased rates of precipitation with increases in sulfate at the time of hydrolysis, it was determined that sulfate served to neutralize positive surface charge and to increase aggregate stability. The sulfate also suppressed structural ordering and altered the morphology, surface area, and color of the synthetic ferrihydrites. The laboratory synthate most similar in color and other properties to the nature stream precipitate was that formed in the presence of 0.1 to 0.15% sulfate.||Despite geologic, gemorphic, and land use differences within the Muskingum River Basin, suspended sediments collected from the Muskingum River and its tributaries during spring flooding were found to be remarkably uniform in mineralogy and size distribution. The most significant evidence of regional differences within the basin came from Moxahala Creek, which is heavily influenced by acid drainage from abandoned coal mines. As a result, Black Fork Creek, a tributary to Moxahala Creek, was chosen for detailed water quality and bottom sediment studies. Marked increases in dissolved SO(, 4), Fe, and Al, together with an associated decrease in pH were observed in sections of the stream affected by acid mine drainage. In addition, a gelatinous yellow precipitate of iron was abundant in the bottom sediments below sources of pollution.

The major difference was that yeast enzyme was found in a mostly latent form which required proteolytic activation for maximal activity while mycelial enzyme was found in a fully active form.

The equation can predict the thermodynamic properties (density, enthalpy departure, and vapor pressure) of a wide range of pure fluids from small, spherical (argon-like) molecules to large structurally complex compounds. For normal paraffins, the size parameter (hard-core volume) is related to the measurable Van der Waals volume given by Bondi (1968). For most other compounds, it is related to the critical volume. The shape parameter values reflect the structure and degree of acentricity of the compound of interest. The equation has been extended to polar and associating compounds by using the effective angle-averaged potential model. For polar compounds, a fourth parameter is required. The equation has been extensively tested for polar (dipolar and quadrupolar) and hydrogen-bonding compounds. The results show that the equation has promise for use for systems occurring in the natural gas, petroleum and synfuels industries.","x, 98 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5124,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 44-02, Section: B, page: 0555.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Engineering, Chemical.",Ph.D.,,A new generalized equation of state for polar and nonpolar pure fluids.,Thesis,(UMI)AAI83147744331,11244/111,,"Van Horn, Curtis W.,",1978,,"vii, 139 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4443,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 39-04, Section: A, page: 1936.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education, General.||Education.",Educat.D.,,"A comparison of attitudes among selected groups of administrators, special education teachers and regular classroom teachers relative to severely/profoundly handicapped students.",Thesis,(UMI)AAI78181684354,11244/111,,"Kim, Kwangok,",1978,,"vii, 228 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4466,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 39-07, Section: A, page: 4402.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Economics.||Economics, Finance.",Ph.D.,,An econometric model of Oklahoma tax revenues :,Thesis,(UMI)AAI78246024300,11244/111,,"Beckham, Laura L.

They were as follows: (1) The Oklahoma system of public school finance did not provide for as much equalization as was possible. (2) The State finance system did not facilitate full and equal educational opportunities for each child in Oklahoma. (3) The State did not assume its responsibility for equalizing the disparities in local fiscal capacity. (4) The sum effect of State appropriated revenues reduced the potential of State appropriation to provide for equality of funding.||There were 16 hypotheses statements tested in this study. Product-moment correlation was used to test Hypotheses 1 through 10. Of these hypotheses statements, only those which provided negative correlation coefficients, significant at the .05 level were accepted. The correlation coefficients for the accepted hypotheses statements were subjected to Fisher's z transformation to determine if significant differences could be observed in the calculated correlation coefficients.||This study was designed to determine the effect legislative appropriation had on equity of financing public schools of Oklahoma during the 1977-78 school year. The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between the per capita valuation and the amount of State support received by local districts in 1977-78. A secondary purpose of the study was to identify the methods of State support possessing the greatest potential to provide equity of funding in the Oklahoma Public School Finance System. Two populations were utilized and analyzed separately in the study. The 623 Oklahoma school districts were classified in 1977-78 as Independent and Dependent.

This instruction has been continuous for periods varying from two to five years depending on the project school. There has been a need for a study that would determine if Cherokee Indian students who received bilingual instruction improved significantly in specific academic areas after an intermediate period of time as compared to a comparable group of Cherokee Indian students who did not received bilingual instruction.||The analysis of covariance was selected as the primary statistical technique, since it allowed one to test for mean differences between the groups with respect to relevant variables. The seven dependent variables used in the analysis were age, sex, I.Q., grade point average, speaker of Cherokee, degree of Indian blood, and father's educational level. The two independent variables used in this study were reading and mathematics achievement mean scores.||The subjects selected for this study were divided into two treatment groups and one control group. The seventeen subjects in the first treatment group were Cherokee Indian students who received bilingual instruction through the Cherokee Bilingual Education Program for five consecutive years. The eighteen subjects in the second treatment group were Cherokee Indian students who had received bilingual instruction through the Cherokee Bilingual Education Program for four consecutive years. The subjects in the two treatment groups comprised nearly one hundred percent of the population who participated in the Cherokee Bilingual Education Program for four or five consecutive years. The eighteen subjects in the control group consisted of comparable Cherokee Indian students who had not received bilingual instruction.||The conclusion derived from this study was that the linguistically deprived Cherokee Indian students need to receive bilingual instruction in order to improve their reading and mathematics achievement. It was also concluded that four consecutive years of bilingual instruction is as effective with linguistically deprived Cherokee Indian children as five consecutive years of bilingual instruction.||The results of the analysis revealed that both treatment groups made significant gains over the control group in reading and mathematics achievement at the .05 level of confidence. A comparison of the adjusted mean scores indicated that there was no significant difference at the .05 level of confidence between the two treatment groups in reading and mathematics achievement.||The purpose of this study was to determine if the eighth grade reading and mathematics achievement scores of Cherokee Indian students who received bilingual instruction in grades one through five were significantly different from the eighth grade reading and mathematics achievement scores of comparable eighth grade Cherokee Indian students who did not receive bilingual instruction. A secondary purpose of this study was to determine whether the eighth grade reading and mathematics achievement scores of five-year bilingual education participants were significantly different from the reading and mathematics achievement scores of four-year bilingual education participants.","vii, 129 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4695,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 41-02, Section: A, page: 0514.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education, Curriculum and Instruction.||Education.",Educat.D.,,A comparative study of achievement test scores between bilingually instructed and nonbilingually instructed Cherokee Indian students.,Thesis,(UMI)AAI80169214625,11244/111,,"Kesselring, Randall G.,",1980,"Section 8 (a) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act makes it unlawful for an employer ""to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it.""

Two instruments, the Demographic Data Questionnaire and the Self-Assessment of Effectiveness Questionnaire, were designed for use in the study.||From the data, the average administrator was 42 years of age, was married, had two children, had served 11 years as a classroom teacher and 7 years as an administrator, had additional work beyond the Master's degree, saw the main reason for becoming an administrator as career advancement, viewed experience as the contributing factor to being employed as an administrator, perceived no constraints on employment opportunities, and planned to remain in the educational field for the next ten years.||The study concluded: (1) self-perception of effectiveness was not influenced significantly by either race or gender; (2) the women in the study perceived their sex as more of a constraint on their being employed as an administrator than minority members viewed their race as a constraint; and (3) when significant differences were found in demographic characteristics, gender, and not race, was the contributing variable.","vi, 117 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4769,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 41-06, Section: A, page: 2542.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education.||Education, Secondary.",Educat.D.,,An analysis of the background profiles and self-assessed effectiveness of Oklahoma public secondary school administrators by race and gender.,Thesis,(UMI)AAI80275174658,11244/111,,"Harrison, Nickie Keith,",1980,"History museums included in the study are making positive contributions to the expansion of opportunities for education of the public through museum facilities, holdings, and educational programs. However, extensive undeveloped potential for such educational opportunity remains.||Recommendations. Further research was recommended concerning: Ways in which museum educational programs might better serve the schools, especially on the secondary level; ways to promote more interaction among the museums and the schools in general in order to generate better, more organized programs; methods for getting museum support groups to become self-motivating and self-perpetuating; the feasibility and need for establishing a national level museums department, which would be responsible solely for museums and which would promote nationwide use of the educational potential of the country's museums by supplying aid for museum educational program development and implementation in the form of advice, consultants, and information on where and how to obtain additional funding; innovative ways to present educational programs in a museum setting rather than merely using public school teaching methods and techniques in the museum; the potential and feasibility of using individually guided, in-house produced educational packets; the potential role in the museum in Community Educational/Life-long Learning educational programs; the effectiveness, in terms of cost and academic potential, of educational programs being carried out through the use of mobile facilities; and ways to establish and maintain a new, formal, statewide plan for financing museums in the state.||Major obstacles to educational program development and implementation as designated by the museum respondents were: insufficient funding, lack of quality personnel, and too few volunteers.||Procedures. In this study twelve history museum directors or the individuals responsible for educational programs were asked to respond to a questionnaire concerning the methods and activities used when developing and implementing educational programs. Only ten museums were included in the study because two did not meet the established criteria. In addition, a follow-up interview was made with the respondent of each museum included in the study in order to supplement and substantiate the data obtained by the questionnaire. The data received from the questionnaire and follow-up interview were tallied and analyzed, resulting in the following conclusions and recommendations.||Through more complete and systematic planning, more extensive and thorough use of human resources in the community, through heightened public awareness of the role museums can play in the education process and the consequent generation of better funding, museums can more nearly come to realize their educational potential.||Purpose. The purpose of this study was to acquire information concerning the methods and activities used by selected history museums in Oklahoma when developing and Implementing educational programs and to formulate from those methods and activities suggestions for future programming in history museums.||No published printed guidelines were reported being used to aid in program development and delivery, and museum respondents considered some practices used to be more useful than others.||In all the sample museums, the director or the officer in charge of educational programs was responsible for carrying out development activities. Museum personnel were those most often involved in the development and delivery of programs, generally for people of all ages, and most often using in-house facilities.||Conclusions. The majority of the museums in the study employed a director and had personnel with college degrees. More of the museums had annual educational program budgets below $3,000 than above, with funds coming primarily from state sources.","v, 74 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4770,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 41-06, Section: A, page: 2423.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education.||Education, Curriculum and Instruction.",Ph.D.,,Development and implementation of educational programs in selected history museums and suggested practices for future programming.,Thesis,(UMI)AAI80275184697,11244/111,,"Cole, James W.,",1980,,"iv, 36 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4809,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 41-09, Section: B, page: 3616.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Psychology, Industrial.||Psychology.",Ph.D.,,Individual differences in decision making :,Thesis,(UMI)AAI81063084705,11244/111,,"Braswell, James Arnold,",1980,"The research examined the impact of the Competency-Based Education movement upon music curricula within higher education in the United States through a two-step survey process and four on-campus visits.

It relates their choices to the internal economic structure of the municipio, and to the overall economic climate in Mexico, as constrained by that nation's place in the world-economy. It considers the impact of modernization on the municipio and analyzes the historical antecedents of present-day adaptations. Finally, it contributes to the general theory of fertility change through the analysis of data concerning these areas.||The last decade has seen a burgeoning of new work on population growth and decline. The widely cited notion of a ""demographic transition"", which correlates population change with industrialization, has not explained demographic trends in non-western countries. Early assumptions that improved survivorship of children would lead fertility to replacement levels have not proved accurate. Further, much of this work proceeds on the assumption that couples make joint decisions to regulate fertility. They neglect to consider how the woman, as a critical participant in the act of reproduction, influences such decisions.||For the women of Baviacora, Sonora, the interaction of modernization and economic crisis leads to changing fertility decisions. In the absence of wage labor or favorable market conditions they cannot increase their contribution to family income by postponing childbearing. They are faced with the day to day task of delegating dwindling household assets to escalating family needs. As the economic, physical and emotional costs of parenting rise rapidly, the only rational strategy for them is to quickly limit family size through fertility regulation. As their roles within the household take on more responsibility, their reproductive strategies become more autonomous. In this instance, women, not couples play the critical role in fertility decisions.||This study is an ethnography of women in a rapidly modernizing, rural municipio in northwest Mexico. It focuses on the individual decision-making processes which lie behind women's reproductive strategies, and how these are motivated by a two-way relationship between economic and biosocial factors. Set against the backdrop of Mexico's economic problems, it examines the ways in which the interaction of modernization and economic crisis lead to a restructuring of the allocation of time, energy, and resources for the women of Baviacora, Sonora.","xvi, 265 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5348,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-08, Section: A, page: 2353.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Mexico Social life and customs.||Women Social conditions.||Anthropology, Cultural.",Ph.D.,,"Markets, motherhood and modernization :",Thesis,(UMI)AAI85230975206,11244/111,,"Lennon, Amelia O.,",1984,"The survey instrument was a general needs checklist consisting of 53 potential preretirement planning topics.

First, a model of the evolution of water rights in the West is developed. In the model, the specification of property rights in water is treated as a continuous variable, ranging from completely non-exclusive to completely exclusive. The particular position on the continuum depends on the benefits of increasing the level of exclusivity relative to the costs. As the net benefits of increasing water right exclusivity increase, the model predicts greater property rights defining and enforcing activity.||The quantitative and historical evidence suggests that water rights exhibit a tendency to develop efficiently, but that this tendency is constrained by the costs of defining exclusive rights to water and by ideology. The costs of defining exclusive property rights depends on the physical nature of the resource and on the expense of litigation and lobbying. Ideological influences appear to have developed in response to monopolistic practices by corporate canals.||In the early property rights literature, the specification of property rights was usually dichotomized: property rights were either completely non-exclusive or they were treated as totally private and exclusive.

The measurement instruments were found appropriate instruments for the collection of data in the public schools of Oklahoma.||This research focused upon the variable domains of decisional states (participatory decision-making) and organizational climate. Participatory decision-making theory and research suggest that there is a decision-making process in every organization. The theory and research on organizational climate suggest that an atmosphere (climate) is inherent in every organization. The problem for this research was: What is the relationship between organizational climate and decisional states?||In summary, the researcher concluded that decisional states scores were not significant predictors of organizational climate pattern scores. This research challenged and contradicted previous research conducted in both participatory decision-making and organizational climate theory and research. It is recommended additional research be done in this area.","vi, 164 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5325,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-01, Section: A, page: 0043.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education, Administration.||Education United States.||Decision making.",Ph.D.,,The effect of decisional states upon organizational climate in public schools /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI85059185203,11244/111,,"Harris, Mary A.",1984,"Chapter eleven examines the poet's use of sound patterns to create meaning in poems and in word plays, and his use of the enjambement to quicken or slow down the pace of a poem, to accommodate its natural rhythm or for emphasis on key words.||Chapter twelve, the conclusion, is a summation of the aspects of Otero's poetry discussed in the study and a comment on his established position among the poets of postwar Spain.||Chapters four through ten treat some elements of the formal structure of Otero's poems, which aim at reaching the masses: the use of epigraphs, the change in verse from the lira and the sonnet to free verse and hybrid forms, circular poems, poems structured as dialogues and conversations, poems without punctuation, those with intercalated quotations and frases hechas, and others that make use of parallelisms and correlations.||Blas de Otero figures among the more eminent poets of the post Civil War period in Spain.

Teachers should use textbooks as one of the many resource materials to which they might refer. They should also refer to Curriculum guidelines proposed at State- and Nation-wide levels when developing objectives for their courses. Authors and publishers of textbooks should consider the inclusion of what geographers and educators recommended to provide in a high school geography course or textbook. Authors and publishers should also revise their textbooks, include more concepts and relationships, and use some of the facts provided to support concepts and relationships. Similar studies were recommended to conduct such as content analysis of other geography textbooks, description of changes in their contents over the years, and assessment of the usefulness of the content analysis method for the analysis of textbooks.||Findings and Conclusions. All five textbooks:  (1) focused on World geography; (2) approached the study of all regions in the world in a ""traditional"" and ""conventional"" way; (3) offered very few of the selected concepts, relationships, and details of selected topics and concepts; (4) relied on the use and provision of factual examples; (5) used summary statements in few instances; (6) relied most on pictures and provided very few tables.||Procedure. The content analysis technique was utilized for analysis and comparison. A list of seven content categories was developed. This list included: Physical, Human, Global, National, and Regional geography, Cartography, and Concepts and Relationships. Each category included several specific points that were analyzed for their inclusion, intensity, and degree of description and examplification. Collected data were re-sorted into nine format categories that analyzed the coverage of: pages devoted to the seven content categories, selected concepts, details of selected topics and concepts, selected relationships, selected facts, some topics for their inclusion or omission, frequency of summary statements, provision of additional points, and frequency of figures and tables.||The major purposes of this study were to do a content analysis of five selected high school geography textbooks and to compare contents provided in each textbook to a list of categories that summarized what geographers and educators would recommend to include in a geography textbook used at the high school level.","xv, 219 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5331,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-06, Section: A, page: 1586.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Geography Textbooks 1945-||Education, Secondary.",Ph.D.,,A content analysis study of five selected high school geography textbooks used in Oklahoma /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI85183045223,11244/111,,"Diba, Massoumeh Metghalchi,",1985,"Taken together, these results suggest that women who drop out of the labor force to raise families cannot expect to earn as much when they return as persons with uninterrupted careers. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)||A dynamic model based on human capital theory was formulated. The model analyzes wages and participation jointly with special attention to heterogeneity and selectivity bias. The model was then estimated using 12 years of longitudinal data from the mature women cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey and only married women were included. This is a sample of 5,083 women who in 1967 were 30 to 44 years of age.||Women have a tendency to interrupt their careers with periods of time spent out of the labor force. Their labor force participation decisions are based on a comparison of the costs and benefits of market work with non-market work. The interruption would normally reduce the earning ability and thus the future participation of the individuals. The objective of this research is to estimate the effect of interruption on earning and labor force participation of married women. Previous research findings do not provide an accurate estimate because of selectivity bias, heterogeneity and not treating wages and participation simultaneously.||When the model was implemented the following results were obtained: (1) Women who have spent more time at home in the past are more likely to remain in the home in the future. (2) The presence of preschool children decreases while the presence of older children increases the probability of a woman working. (3) Although part-time work carries with it fewer opportunities for advancement than full-time, it is a substitute for full withdrawal from the labor force. (4) Nonwhite workers have a higher tendency to have irregular employment patterns than the white ones. (5) Women facing larger penalties for their interruption will tend to shorten the length of their time out of the labor force. (6) It was estimated that the long-run wage loss was in the neighborhood of 9 to 10 percent for each year of work.","ix, 143 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5335,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-10, Section: A, page: 3118.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Women Employment.||Economics, Labor.||Wages Women.",Ph.D.,,The effect of interruption on earning and labor force participation of married women /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI85212695227,11244/111,,"Bart, Henry L.,",1985,"Fish assemblages from main channel riffle habitats varied independently with little evidence of stability.

The pattern corresponds with a predictable pattern of resource limitation, and suggests equilibrium structure based on occurrences of interspecific competition. However, the summer-fall period coincided with the period of post-larval recruitment. During this period pool assemblages were dominated by young-of-year of species that occurred across habitat types, suggesting that the pattern of stability and resiliency was dependent on ephemerally high abundances of fish recruits.

Placing Sand Creek within the context of similar events throughout American history--from the massacre of the Pequots at Mystic in 1637 to My Lai--it treats Sand Creek not as an anomaly but as a human tragedy of which every generation is capable.||On November 29, 1864, United States volunteers under the command of Colonel John Milton Chivington attacked a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians on Sand Creek in eastern Colorado Territory, killing more than 150 men, women, and children. The ""Sand Creek Massacre, "" as the incident came to be called, prompted two congressional hearings and a military investigation, contributed to worsening Indian-white relations on the central plains, and precipitated a public controversy which fueled a historical debate which still rages today. In this case study of Indian-white conflict, the view that the United States government systematically followed a policy of genocide against the Indians and the notion that massacres can be dismissed as the psychotic behavior of a few individuals are both rejected. The study argues instead that massacres are the work of ordinary people under stress.||This study examines the Sand Creek affair in two ways. First, it presents a detailed chronological account of the origins and consequences of the massacre, examining the multiplicity of forces at work in the tragedy. Special attention is given to the cultural differences between the Cheyennes and the Americans, to white attitudes toward the natives, to political and personal motives of the principal characters, and to the factors which transformed a frontier skirmish into a public controversy. Second, the study examines the Sand Creek Massacre as a symbol of the failure of American Indian policy in the nineteenth century and seeks to find in the symbology of Sand Creek keys to understanding why massacres occur. The study explores in the rationale of massacre in Colorado, probes the historical controversy from its origins in the aftermath of the massacre to its present manifestations in historical and popular writing, and examines the use of the Sand Creek image by the Indian reform movement and by modern reformers.","2 v.

Specifically, it aimed at examining whether, and why, the Nigerian foreign policy manifested the phenomenon of nonalignment, or failed to do so, during the period spanning from 1960 - 1983.||On the main issue of the nonalignment content in the Nigerian foreign policy, this study found that, during different political eras in Nigeria, different mixes of factors were at work. Namely, during the First Republic, the factors of a government made up of a coalition of moderates, and the significant role of assertive radical elements in the fringes of the governmental structure, and as pressure groups, resulted in Nigeria being able to be nonaligned. The succeeding Ironsi government, due to its very brief, and crisis-ridden, duration, was also found to manifest nonalignment phenomenon in the same way as did the First Republic. The Gowon government that followed, however, due to the realities of the Civil War, and the existence of a cautious government, was able to exhibit a nonaligned posture that, despite warm relations with the East, was still firmly adequate. The assertive national leadership during the Muhammed/Obasanjo government meant also an assertive nonaligned posture, while the Second Republic nonalignment phenomenon was, more or less, a replication of the First Republic dynamics and posture.||Additionally, although the nonaligned content of the Nigerian foreign policy varied with different political eras, all of the eras (especially the last three) were found to have manifested a mostly Afro-centric conceptual perspective, and foreign policy mechanism dimension of nonalignment.","xi, 327 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5332,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-06, Section: A, page: 1730.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Nigeria Politics and government 1960-1975.||Political Science, International Law and Relations.||Nigeria Politics and government 1975-",Ph.D.,,The concept of nonalignment and the Nigerian foreign policy 1960-1983 /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI85183055228,11244/111,,"Bryant, Dorothy E.,",1985,"A significant correlation was not observed between analytical observations and memorization efficiency.

The results of this study support the view that a treatment consisting of more than one type of test-like events may be the best overall strategy for a Calculus I lecture. However, the long-term effect on achievement may not be of great educational significance. In addition, the prior knowledge of Calculus I students has little influence on the effectiveness of a test-like events treatment.||Results. A Hotelling-Lawley trace 3 x 2 (treatment x prior knowledge) MANOVA test revealed an overall treatment effect (p < .05) and no overall treatment x prior knowledge interaction effect. Three of the eight univariate ANOVA tests revealed significant treatment effects--all three on measurements of concept/principle learning. Newman-Keuls pairwise comparisons showed that the both question type group significantly outperformed the skill only group on three measurements of concept/principle learning and significantly outperformed the control group on one measurement of concept-principle learning.||Procedure. Three sections of Calculus I served as treatment groups. Students in the control group received no test-like events. Students in one experimental group received only skill level test-like events. Students in a second experimental group received both skill and concept/principle level test-like events. A correct response to each test-like event was given by the instructor following time given to the students to make overt written responses. The treatment lasted fifteen weeks and was interspersed with four criterion tests, each composed of a measurement of skill level learning and one of concept/principle learning.||Purpose. This study investigated the effectiveness of test-like events during lecture in the facilitation of learning mathematics. The basis of the study was that test-like events may affect one or more aspects of attention including length, intensity, type (selective or nonselective) and direction (backward or forward), depending on the type of test-like events, type of learning outcome measured, and learner characteristics. Support for this framework was provided by the literature on analogous studies that investigated the effect of test-like events in text, electronic student response systems, and general classroom questioning.","vi, 109 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5347,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-08, Section: A, page: 2221.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education, Mathematics.||Lectures and lecturing.||Attention.",Ph.D.,,The effect of test-like events during mathematics lecture /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI85230965243,11244/111,,"Olia, Fatemeh Nezhat,",1985,"This study investigated the effect of mental imagery as a strategy for comprehending prose materials presented orally.

Three sets of problems come to mind:  (1) the PRC must violate its own constitution in order to give effect to this agreement; (2) the agreement is quite vague on several key issues; and (3) over the next sixty years there will be numerous changes in the leadership and policies of the PRC, some of which could negatively impact upon Hong Kong.||The author reviews the history of China's relationship with Britain as it relates to the Hong Kong issue. He then discusses the Sino-British negotiations, analyzing factors that conditioned the bargaining positions of both parties. He bases his study on a framework which includes symbolic issues (sovereignty, national prestige, and human rights), economic and diplomatic considerations, and the role of the Hong Kong people. Overall, the PRC had a stronger stance mainly because of Hong Kong's heavy material dependence upon mainland China and the PRC's manipulation of nationalistic symbols. However, this stronger position was tempered by diplomatic considerations. The PRC wanted to appear to be ""reasonable"" in order to improve its relations with the ASEAN states and Taiwan.||Despite an international situation that had existed for more than 140 years with serious difficulties at times, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the United Kingdom (UK) reached a solution to their dispute over Hong Kong within a two-year period through diplomatic negotiations. The PRC would not recognize all of the Hong Kong treaties while the UK asserted that it had treaty rights over Hong Kong. According to the 1984 agreement, the PRC will recover all of the territory of Hong Kong in July 1997 and will not impose its socialist system immediately. Hong Kong's capitalist system and life-style will be allowed to exist until 2047.

The second line of argument, one Mill seemed to think was the strongest, is based on the fear of legal moralism. The third argument holds that the model of good parenting requires non coercive means of control for self-regarding behavior. The final argument might best be described as the dilemma of paternalistic punishment. This argument maintains that punishment for self-regarding conduct on grounds of beneficence undermines the beneficence.

The population consisted of all new, full-time freshmen (9262) enrolled at the University of Oklahoma from 1981 through 1984; 6975 subjects were derived from the population based on whether or not they had completed the New Student Survey, an instrument designed to solicit a wide variety of information about University of Oklahoma students. Forty-six percent of the subjects were found to be underachievers and 28% were found to be overachievers.||One-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences among under- and overachievers on thirty-seven of sixty-nine variables. Highlights of the findings include the following: both groups had similar minority student representations, came from families with similar economic backgrounds, had similar degree aspirations, had similar expectations to pledge a fraternity or sorority, and shared similar political attitudes. Underachievers had higher high school GPAs, were older, were more likely to be male, came from smaller cities, had parents with less education, were more sure of their academic major and vocational plans, exhibited more liberal attitudes toward social issues, were more likely to drink alcohol, and were more likely to attend OU because of its farness from home than were overachievers.||Conversely, overachievers had lower high school GPAs, earned more hours their freshman year, were younger, were more likely to be female and an Oklahoma resident, were more likely to live on campus, and were less sure of their academc and vocational goals; they placed more importance on developing a sense of personal identity, social interaction skills, tolerance toward others, an awareness of other cultures, and communication skills; they had more conservative attitudes toward social issues and were more likely to choose to attend OU because of their parents' wishes, the advice of friends, financial aid benefits, and because of OU's proximity to their homes.","vii, 134 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5379,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-12, Section: A, page: 3617.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Education, Higher.||Academic achievement.",Ph.D.,,Characteristics which distinguish between underachieving and overachieving freshmen at a comprehensive state university /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI86027165276,11244/111,,"Harris, Clyta Foster,",1985,"Two traumatic events provoked dramatic changes beginning in the early seventies--the Oklahoma State Prison riot and fire of July 1973, and the federal court case Battle v. Anderson and its initial court order of 1974. The riot and fire forced renovation and new construction of prison facilities throughout the system. This study traces physical plant expansion from a system with two main institutions, three satellites, and no community treatment centers; to a system with one maximum security prison, thirteen medium/minimum institutions, and eight community treatment centers. The eleven-year Battle v. Anderson case and its resultant court order of 1974 forced officials to correct alleged inhumane confinement of prisoners in violation of their constitutionally guaranteed civil rights.||The administrations of two governors--David L. Boren and George Nigh--were instrumental in the reform of Oklahoma's prison system. Both were committed to the philosophy of rehabilitation and reform, and placed high priorities on training, educating, and reforming inmates. From a budget of $5 million in 1967, to a budget of $97.5 million in 1983, taxpayers financed the development of a system which brought the Oklahoma prison system out of the dark ages and into the 20th century.||Oklahoma corrections changed more during the 16-year period covered by this study than during the entirety of its 60-year pre-1967 history. The passage of House Bill 566, better known as the Oklahoma Corrections Act of 1967, began the process of centralizing operations and removed corrections from the control of the Stae Board of Public Affairs.","viii, 256 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5388,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-12, Section: A, page: 3868.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Prisons Oklahoma.||Sociology, Criminology and Penology.",Ph.D.,,"A history of the Oklahoma prison system, 1967-1983 /",Thesis,(UMI)AAI86035125284,11244/111,,"Spigner-littles, Dorscine,",1985,"Unique skills reported in response to open-ended items reflected the core values and philosophy of the student personnel and student development movement. These skills indicated that practicing CSAOs report a desire to serve the operational needs of students. In contrast, the respondents' identification of the ten highest ranked items and ten lowest ranked items failed to suggest a student orientation.||Tests of significance revealed that gender, educational background (field related vs. non-field related) and the interaction of the two variables had differential effects on Factor I, while the tests on Factor II revealed no significant differences among the four subgroups. The results indicated that the female CSAO whose training was non-field related had higher means in overall ratings of skills, meaning that they rated each of the skills as being of less importance than the other three groups. They placed a high focus upon the accomplishment of specific tasks that were direct components of the student services functions.||From a review of pertinent research and literature, a questionnaire was developed and sent to 197 CSAOs at state universities with student populations of 9000 or more. Responses were received from 153 which generated 139 usable questionnares or 71% of the targeted population.||Factor analysis of the skills identified from the literature resulted in two principal factors being identified and retained, Conceptual Skills and Technical Skill.||The purpose of this study was to determine from practitioners, perceptions of the skills most important to Chief Student Affairs Officers (CSAOs), to determine if there were differences in perceptions based upon differences in gender (male vs. female) and educational background (field related vs. non-field related), and to determine if there were skills or competencies perceived as being unique to the field.||Ranking the skills by mean values revealed that the sample group fundamentally agreed that CSAOs needed human relations skills, basic administrative skills, decision making ability and an organizational sense of the function of student affairs in relation to the whole institution. Seven of the ten competencies that the CSAOs reported as not necessary were skills that could be delegated to subordinates.","xi, 194 leaves :",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5396,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 47-02, Section: A, page: 0438.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Student activities.||Personnel management.||Education, Higher.",Ph.D.,,Perceptions of skills and competencies necessary to become an effective Chief Student Affairs Officer /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI86035205285,11244/111,,"Williamson, Gerald W.,",1985,"It has long been recognized that varying degrees of consumer competency exist among the general population. This study represents an attempt to compare consumer competencies of high school seniors in selected Rocky Mountain states. Areas of primary concern dealt with the comparison by states as well as by the size of school. Also included in the study were comparisons based on gender, race, and family income. Schools were chosen from eight states, and the chosen schools were classified in three categories based on enrollment figures for the entire school system. A fifty question consumer economics examination was given to a total of 751 high school seniors. This survey exposed a low comprehension of consumer knowledge for high school seniors. Indications are that the greatest discrepancies appear along racial lines. School size has a minor bearing on the subject according to this study, while state by state impact is only marginal.","v, 74 leaves ;",http://hdl.handle.net/11244/5397,,"Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 46-12, Section: A, page: 3576.",The University of Oklahoma.,"Consumers.||Education, Business.",Ph.D.,,An analysis of high school seniors' consumer competencies in selected schools in the Rocky Mountain states /,Thesis,(UMI)AAI86035215292,11244/111,,"Mcclung, Jacquetta Parker,",1985,"The hypotheses tested asked a general question: Is there an association between entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance using the ratios of the strategic profit model?

In this study the method of differential quadratures is investigated as a technique for practical numerical solutions of transport models. The fundamental feature of this method is that it replaces a partial derivative with a weighted linear sum at discrete points. Consequently a dynamic transport model in terms of partial differential equations is reduced to a set of time dependent ordinary differential equations which can be solved by one of the many integration techniques available. A time independent transport model in terms of partial differential equations, on the other hand, is reduced to a set of algebraic equations for which numerical solution techniques are well developed.||In the first part of this dissertation, the derivative and integral approximation formulas that are most often required for transport models are presented. Next, the dissertation is devoted to the development of the methodology for solving transport models using this technique. Finally, it is demonstrated on a relatively complicated process involving simultaneous mass, momentum, and energy transfer process. For this purpose, the near-field atmospheric dispersion process for vapors arising from liquefied gases, liquefied natural gas (LNG) in particular, is modeled by including (1) the time-dependent terms, (2) coupled overall mass, vapor mass, and overall momentum and energy equations, as well as (3) a gradient turbulence model. Three multiple-gradient transient models are proposed with increasing sophistication: (1) a two-dimensional dispersion model for a ground level line source, using the Boussinesq approximation, (2) a three-dimensional dispersion model for relatively small spills, using the Boussinesq approximation, and (3) a three-dimensional dispersion model for relatively large spills, using a hydrostatic approximation in the vertical direction. The approximate numerical models are obtained by the method of differential quadratures. Comparisons with other numerical calculation techniques are presented for vapor dispersion from LNG spills.
